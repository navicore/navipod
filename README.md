A TUI and CLI for Inspecting Containers in Kubernetes
============

![an image showing navipod inspecting replicas and pod and ingress](docs/demo.png)

Alpha - Under constant development as I practice Rust programming and discover
needs not met by other tools.

The command uses the local kubecontext credentials to access Kubernetes clusters.

The primary use case of the tool is to get quick answers to replica and pod
and ingress state.

The tool also captures data to an embedded DB for exporting as RDF.

It will get Prometheus data from pods which are annotated for Prometheus
using the convention:

```
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/path: "/actuator/prometheus"
        prometheus.io/port: "8081"
```

The cli supports exporting the db to both N-Triple and Turtle RDF files.

Install
----------

```bash
#latest stable version via https://crates.io/crates/navipod
cargo install navipod

#or from this repo:
cargo install --path .
```

Configure for tab completion:

```bash
navipod generate-completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_navipod
```

Usage
---------

from `navipod -h`

```
